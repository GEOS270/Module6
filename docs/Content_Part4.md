# Sampling and Inverse Distance Weighting

This [Arc Project](https://github.com/GEOS270/Module6/blob/main/data/Sampling_Interpolation.zip) shows how we can create random points in Arc and use them collect samples.  It also shows how we can run inverse distance weighting and highlights the influence of sample size and sampling method.

### TopHat Question 1

Stratified sampling is an unbiased sampling method. 

* True
* False

### TopHat Question 2

Spatial ___ is a way to "fill in the blanks".  We can it to estimate the values of a continuous field (raster) from samples at point locations.

* Extrapolation
* Interpolation
* Explanation
* Interpretation



# Resolution and Data Model Conversion

This [Arc Project](https://github.com/GEOS270/Module6/blob/main/data/Resolution_and_Conversion.zip) shows how we can create lines and polygons from points in Arc and illustrates the concept of vector resolution.  It also shows how we can create rasters from vector features (points, lines, or polygons), illustrates the concept of raster resolution, and shows how errors can cascade when converting between data models.

### TopHat Question 3

Vector resolution is determined by the:

* Cell size
* Number of vertices (points)
* Number of columns in the attribute table
* All of the above

### TopHat Question 4

Raster resolution is determined by the:

* Cell size
* Extent of the raster
* Number of bands in the raster
* All of the above
