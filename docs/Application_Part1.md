# Setup

Create a new project called PA_RiskAssessment_Update.  You should complete these general steps.  Refer to the short video at the bottom of the page for reference.

**1**{: .label .label-red } Import the PA_DEM_ProjectRaster from your Module 5 project (PA_RiskAssessment).
* **Note** the video below referrers to the original PA_RiskAssessment as Module 4, because I changed the ordering of modules after the video was recorded.
    * Aside from the naming conventions, everything else in the video is correct.

**2**{: .label .label-red } Create a new Feature Dataset called Inputs and import the waterbodies layer.

**3**{: .label .label-red } Set your basemap to the Hybrid Satellite layer.
