# Final Analysis

## Risk level of shelter locations

Import the shelters layer from the original PA_RiskAssessment (Module 5).  Using either visual inspection, or the "Zonal Statistics as Table" tool, determine the risk classification for each of the 3 tsunami shelters in Port Alberni.
* Hint - The easiest way is to import it to your Inputs Feature Dataset using the "import feature class" tool.
* If using the zonal statistics tool, make sure to use the shelters as the feature zone data and to set "Name" as the zone field.
* Take note of the risk class (or lack thereof) for each shelter.  This is a quiz answer.

## Your model

Export your model as a .pdf and submit it on canvas.  

## Final Map

Create map showing the Tsunami Inundation risk classification for Port Alberni and the location of the tsunami evacuation shelters and submit it on canvas as well.  The final map should include:

**1**{: .label .label-red } The inundation zone you created using the weighted overlay method.
* Make sure to use an appropriate color scheme.
**2**{: .label .label-red } The three tsunami shelters
**3**{: .label .label-red } The satellite base map
**4**{: .label .label-red } All relevant map elements.
* You can list google earth engine as the DEM data source and the City of Port Alberni as the "Waterbodies" data source.
