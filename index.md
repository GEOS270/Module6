# Sampling, Uncertainty, and Ethics

This module will discuss techniques for spatial sampling and interpolation, followed by a broad discussion on types of uncertainty in GIS, both quantifiable errors and other issues that can be harder to explicitly define.  Then we will close out the term with a discussion of ethical practices in GIS.
