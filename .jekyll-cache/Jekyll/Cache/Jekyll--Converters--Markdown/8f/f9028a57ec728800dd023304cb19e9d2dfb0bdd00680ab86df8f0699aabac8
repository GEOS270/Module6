<p>Burnabyâ€™s population is closest to that of <strong>__</strong>__ but because they have different areas , they have very different population densities.  Vancouverâ€™s area is closest to that of <strong>__</strong>__ but because they have different populations, they have very different population densities.</p>

<p><a href="Content_Part3.md"><strong>5</strong></a></p>

<p>These discrepancies are attributable to something known as the <strong>__</strong>__ , because municipal boundaries are somewhat arbitrarily defined.  It is important to consider this issue when comparing values like population between different cities/regions/countries etc.</p>
