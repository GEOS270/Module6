<p>Use the weighted overlay tool to create an Inundation Risk layer.  You should complete these general steps.  Refer to the short video at the bottom of the page for reference.</p>

<p><strong class="label label-red">1</strong> Add the weighted overlay tool to the model and set the reclassified layers as the inputs.</p>

<p><strong class="label label-red">2</strong> Set the weights for the <strong>Elevation Layer</strong> layer following the image below.  Elevation should have a weight of 75%.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The scale should increase sequentially (i.e., 1, 2, 3 â€¦ 10) for the field values.
    <ul>
      <li>We are doing this because the spacing used in the reclassify step was 2m for each class.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong class="label label-red">3</strong> Set the weights for the <strong>Distance</strong> following the image below.  Distance should have a weight of 25%.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The scale <strong>is not</strong> increasing sequentially for the field values.
    <ul>
      <li>We are doing this because the spacing used in the reclassify step was not consistent for each class.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
